# github-ssh-ci-runner

Run a custom command (like your specialized CI) on a remote server via github actions on push/pull_requests.

## Setup

### Remote Server

- Create a new ssh-key (referenced later with `ssh-pub-key` and `ssh-priv-key`). \
  The public and private part are **both exposed**.
- Create a `cirunner` user with password login locked (`usermod --lock cirunner`). \
  For extra security configure systemd logind with 
  ```properties
  KillUserProcesses=true
  KillOnlyUsers=cirunner
  ```
- create `~cirunner/.ssh/authorized_keys` with `<ssh-pub-key>` replaced:
  ```
  command="$HOME/bin/github-ssh-ci-runner $HOME/ci-config.toml",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding <ssh-pub-key>
  ```
- copy the release binary of `github-ssh-ci-runner` in `~cirunner/bin/`
- create `~cirunner/ci-config.toml`: 
  ```
  runner = [ "/path/to/your_ci_script", "arg1", "arg2" ]
  repos = [ "userfoo/repobar", "userfoo/repobaz" ]
  ```
  `runner` is the path and arguments to your custom CI script. \
  `repos` specifies the allowed github repositories, which are allowed to trigger the ci. \
  \
  Ideally the real `your_ci_script` runs a rootless `podman` test container, which is removed after the run. \
  We opened an [issue](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6412) against podman to request a timeout option for `podman run`. \
  \
  The test container can then checkout the git repo via the environment variables:
  - `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
  - `GITHUB_SHA`
  - `GITHUB_REF`
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/"$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" testrepo
  cd testrepo
  git fetch origin "$GITHUB_REF"
  git checkout -b testbranch FETCH_HEAD
  # run your CI with the repo
  [â€¦]
  ```
### Github Actions

- In the repo to test check in the private ssh key `ssh-priv-key` under `.ssh/id_github_remote_ci`.
- Create an action (with `<YOUR_CI_HOSTNAME>` replaced):

```yaml
name: remote-ci

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 60
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: github-ssh-ci-runner
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        chmod 0700 .ssh
        chmod 0600 .ssh/id_github_test
        exec ssh -T -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i .ssh/id_github_remote_ci <YOUR_CI_HOSTNAME> -- "$GITHUB_TOKEN" "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" "$GITHUB_SHA" "$GITHUB_REF"
```

Watch your remote CI get executed on `push` and `pull_request`.

## Security

Because of `command=` in `.ssh/.authorized_keys` an attacker can only control `"$GITHUB_TOKEN" "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" "$GITHUB_SHA" "$GITHUB_REF"`.

`github-ssh-ci-runner`
- sanity checks those parameters
- checks if `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is allowed in the config toml
- checks if the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid for the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` via the github API v3.0 \
  The `GITHUB_TOKEN` seems to be useable only for one action job run and expires after 60 minutes.
- checks if `GITHUB_SHA` matches `GITHUB_REF` via the github API v3.0
- executes the `runner` with only those environment variables set

So, an attacker has to open a valid pull request against the repository.

In this pull request the attacker can modify all parts which are read and executed in the CI, and even modify the original github action.

Therefore the remote side has to ensure, that there is a time limit for the test and all remaining processes are killed.

systemd logind can help with killing of all remaining processes.

A proper cleanup is more difficult. We suggest starting a container, which is automatically cleaned up after the timeout.

As mentioned, a rootless podman container is ideal, if the [timeout](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6412) feature is implemented.

Checkout of the git repo should happen in the container.

File an issue, if you know other attack scenarios.
